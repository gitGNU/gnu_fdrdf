INSTALL  -*- Text -*-

        The installation of FDRDF is as simple as doing (as `root'):

# make install 

        But one's encouraged to check whether the settings at the top of
        `Makefile' match the particular Perl setup.

        It's possible to install the package under a regular user's home
        directory (assuming PATH includes "${HOME}/bin" and PERLLIB
        includes "${HOME}/lib/site_perl"):

$ make prefix="$HOME" install 

        For packaging purposes, it may be convenient to use `DESTDIR',
        like:

$ make DESTDIR="${PWD}/debian/dist" \
      prefix=/usr perllibdir=/usr/share/perl5 \
      install 

Local variables:
fill-column: 72
indent-tabs-mode: nil
End:
INSTALL ends here
