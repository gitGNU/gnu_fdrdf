INSTALL  -*- Text -*-

        The installation of FDRDF is as simple as doing (as `root'):

# make install 

        But one's encouraged to check whether the settings at the top of
        `Makefile' match the particular Perl setup.

        It's possible to install the package under a regular user's home
        directory (assuming PATH includes "${HOME}/bin" and PERLLIB
        includes "${HOME}/lib/site_perl"):

$ make prefix="$HOME" install 

        For packaging purposes, it may be convenient to use `DESTDIR',
        like:

$ make DESTDIR="${PWD}/debian/dist" \
      prefix=/usr perllibdir=/usr/share/perl5 \
      install 

        For testing, my personal preference is as follows:

$ (d="+dist-$(date +%s)" \
       && LC_ALL=C /usr/bin/time make DESTDIR="$d" doc install \
              2>&1 | tee +install-$(date +%s).log ; \
       LC_ALL=C tree "$d") 

        Such an install could then be tested like (substitute
        `+dist-1284382964' in the command below with the actual
        directory made at the previous step):

$ (sha1 () { sed -e '/\<_:r[0-9]*r[0-9]*r/s//_:r/' \
                 | LC_ALL=C sort | sha1sum; } \
       && p=+dist-1284382964/usr/local \
       && PERLLIB="$p"/lib/site_perl "$p"/bin/fdrdf -m 'file grib sha1' \
              -t ntriples -- \
              ladsftp.nascom.nasa.gov/allData/5/SEA_ICE/2010/242/eng.100831 \
              | sha1 \
       && PERLLIB="$p"/lib/site_perl "$p"/bin/fdrdf -m 'file gdal sha1' \
              -t ntriples -- \
