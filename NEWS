NEWS --- Noteworthy changes in FDRDF  -*- outline -*-

* Noteworthy changes in release 0.2 (2010-09-12)

** Incompatible changes

    The API for FDRDF modules was switched to use Perl objects.  All the
    modules that come with FDRDF were updated.

    The new `mark' FDRDF module replaces the former `test' one.
    Although the `mark' module can be configured to emulate `test', it's
    not the default.

** New features

    New `--storage-' options allow the tool to put the descriptions into
    the Redland RDF storages directly.

    The `--config-file=FILE' (`-c') option has finally been implemented.

    New `--no-output' option to suppress the serialized output when not
    needed.

** New FDRDF modules

    New `gdal' FDRDF module, based on the `Geo::GDAL' Perl module.  This
    module should be preferred to the older `gdalinfo' one, which relies
    on parsing of the gdalinfo(1) output.

** Bug fixes

    Implemented `DESTDIR' support.

    Fixed a silly bug in `$ make install'.

    Miscellaneous minor bug fixes.

** Improvements

    Minor improvements to the fdrdf(1) manual page and README.

    Each module now has its own unique (uuid: scheme) URI.

    Code clean-ups.
